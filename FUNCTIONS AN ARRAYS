# FUNCTIONS AND ARRAYS
In a directory named A4, create an index.html. The only thing is has to do is display an image contained in your img folder and load your css and javascript files, which you'll place in folders named css and scripts. Name those files a4.css and a4.js You can put more in the index.html if you like, but just make sure it loads your css and javascript files and displays the image.

In your css file, give your page a background color and put a 5 pixel, solid black border around the image.

* In your javascript file, create an array called numArray that holds the numbers 1 through 50. ( [ 1, 2, 3, 4, ... 50 ] ).
* Use the map() method on the array and an arrow function to transform the array into 50 multiples of 5 ( [ 5, 10, 15, 20, ... 250 ]. (Make sure you assign the result of the mapping back to the numArray array itself in this and the following steps.) Print the result to the console.
* Then use the map() method with an arrow function to set all multiples of 3 to zero ( [ 5, 10, 0, 20, 25, 0, 35, 40, 0, ... ] ). Print the result to the console.
* Then use the map() method to subtract 1 from all multiples of 10 that are greater than 1 ( [5, 9, 0, 19, 25, 0, 35, 39, 0, ... ] ). Print the result to the console.
* numArray should hold this final result.
